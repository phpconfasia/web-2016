                      <p>PHP developers today are spoilt for choice when choosing a framework to use for their applications. Frameworks have come a long way from isolated libraries of code to embodiments of design patterns and best practices. This is in no small way due to PSR (PHP Standard Recommendation). Thanks to it, one can even mix and match components from different frameworks! This tutorial seeks to bring more awareness, appreciation and encourage adoption of PSRs as we sit down together to understand the fundamentals and try our hands at implementing some of them.</p>

                      <h4>Drupal site building for developer</h4>
                      <p>There are multiple ways to build sites in Drupal but only few are considered the Drupal Way™, and it can sometimes get quite opinionated. In the end, we need to balance between requirement, technical debt, scalability, maintainability, without sacrificing security and performance.</p>
                      <p>In this tutorial, we will go through Drupal site building from a developer's perspectives. It will cover:</p>
                      <p>1. Drupal Architectural Kata workshop, similar to the one we conducted in one of our past meetups.</p>
                      <p>2. Drupal site building.</p>
                      <p>3. Drupal configuration management.</p>
                      <p>Requirement:</p>
                      <p> - No Drupal knowledge is required.</p>
                      <p> - Bring your own laptop already installed with *AMP, Drupal 8, drush (I will update details on how to install).</p>

                      <p>Code archaeology is one of the most important skills you’ll ever learn as a developer. How many times have you been thrown into projects with no environment setup, no documentation, and very little support from coworkers? Being able to quickly work out how an application is structured so that you can start making changes is a sought after skill for many employers.</p>
                      <p>In this talk, we’ll take an open source project that we’ve never seen before and work through the steps required to get it up and running so that we can start working on features. Once you know the steps, they can be applied to any project in any language to get you contributing in no time.</p>

                      <h4>From PHP to Hack as a Stack and Back</h4>
                      <p>It was 2014 and our business was humming along using an in house CMS named “Nuts n Bolts”. We had been handed some large projects and we knew we were pushing its boundaries.
                      <p>Along the way, we hit performance roadblocks. And one after another, we patched them. Our little CMS was growing quickly, but it’s architecture meant it would never be able to truly be what we were trying to force it to be.</p>
                      <p>Patches turned into hacks, hacks turned into performance bottlenecks, and bottlenecks crashed servers. High traffic? Uh, nice try. Big Data? Not a chance! Now resembling a patchwork quilt of patches stacked on other patches, our little CMS was showing signs that it wasn’t able to handle anything bigger.</p>
                      <p>It’s now early 2015 and some very large projects are on the horizon. Our little CMS, no longer little, no longer a CMS and it’s the wrong tool for what is to come. Time to find another solution.</p>
                      <p>At the time, the landscape was interesting. And yet, it wasn’t exactly where we needed it to be. There were certainly some great frameworks available, but they didn’t work the way we liked them to, and they didn’t fit with the new methodologies and practices which we wanted to introduce into our development environment.</p>
                      <p>Namely, we wanted an environment where we could focus writing new code, not trying to fix quirks and bugs. We needed our developers to understand what was going on the moment they looked at the code and not have to guess what may or may not happen.</p>
                      <p>We needed a strongly typed language. We needed something strict like Java. But we don’t do Java. We’re a PHP shop, and we don’t want to have to force all of our developers to learn a new language.</p>
                      <p>At the time, PHP 7 was a consideration, but it was a long way off. It had no set release date, and software schedules frequently slip, we concluded that this was not an option.</p>
                      <p>There were some other new high-performance PHP options as well. But ultimately, we settled on Hack, running on Facebook’s HHVM.</p>
                      <p>This isn’t a story about migration of a framework. It’s not a story about building another framework. It’s a story about a one company’s journey from a chaotic, typeless development environment, to a strict, issue free, strongly typed world where every developer involved came out better, and the products we produced were something to be proud of.</p>
                      <p>In this presentation, I will take the audience on our journey. I will cover:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Where we started.</li>
                        <li>The lessons we learned.</li>
                        <li>The successes we had.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Then I will get a little bit more in-depth into Hack and look at:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>How to get started.</li>
                        <li>Main differences between PHP5/7 and Hack.</li>
                        <li>Pitfalls to watch out for.</li>
                        <li>What to do if you get stuck.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h4>Rapid REST API Development with Symfony</h4>
                      <p>Almost all modern web applications consume third-party APIs. It is relatively easy and there is plenty of tutorials about integration with Facebook, Twitter and other popular services. However, what happens when it is our responsibility to provide someone else with an API?
                      <p>Many developers still have very little knowledge about APIs and how to create them properly. In this talk I want to introduce audience to core principles of API development and show them how to implement it in under a minute.</p>
                      <p>Symfony ecosystem has some great tools, which are helpful with API development. Thanks for the framework flexibility, I was able to come up with a unique combination of these libraries and Symfony way of doing things. While working on Sylius, I created SyliusResourceBundle, which provides generic CRUD controller for your entities and is format agnostic, which means it can serve JSON, XML and HTML as response.</p>
                      <p>Talk is practice-oriented and contains many code examples and live demos.</p>

                      <p>Born in November 1992, I have built my first website at the age of 12. While in high school, I have worked for my first customers and created initial bits of code, which ultimately became an Open Source project. Few years into the future, Sylius is one of the most promising eCommerce platforms in the world of PHP, with over 320 code contributors. Our packages have been downloaded over 2,000,000 times.
                      These days I am busy leading the project towards stable release and managing a commercial, company Lakion that emerged from Sylius’ popularity in 2014. We support the community and provide training, consultation and development for brands & start-ups who want to power their business with Sylius technology.
                      I am also involved in my local PHP community, as co-organizer of PHPers, which is all about free and open meetups for developers in most of big cities in Poland. We are aiming to change the perception of PHP as a language and bring more people to the community by sharing knowledge and socializing. I am responsible for organizing PHPers events in my hometown - Łódź.</p>

                      <p>Your users complain about the bad performance of your app or website? Developers blame the database? How can we find the cause for the performance hotspot?</p>
                      <p>Far too often the database is held responsible for performance or scalability problems. It seems to be main contributor to the overall web request response time. However, in many cases it’s not the database itself, but the way, how the application is using the database! Too many database statements, inefficient queries and poor index selection are among the common problem patterns.</p>
                      <p>Based on real life examples, you will learn how to approach performance problems, how to figure out if the database is really to blame and how to end the finger pointing between developers and DBAs.</p>

                      <h4>How I learn good programming by learning Drupal</h4>
                      <p>I coded Mastermind) on BASIC when I was 12.</p>
                      <p>I embedded Star Wars opening theme on the 8080 board during the wire wrapping and assembly language lab in university.</p>
                      <p>Sometimes I wonder if my geekiness is a blessing or a curse. On hindsight, it may have been a curse that it inflated my ego not to take the computer science / engineering course, thinking that I could learn all these by myself.</p>
                      <p>Fast forward to present day. I'm responsible for a team who builds some of the largest Drupal sites in Singapore, and beyond, in a world where web development is getting more complex and getting closer to software development workflow. With Drupal, we can build some sites without writing any single line of custom code. But with more complex UX design requirement, it is getting harder not to customise Drupal core functions. When Drupal 8 architecture allows customisation without hacking the core modules, there is little excuse for me not to learn good programming skills.</p>
                      <p>In this session, I will share:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>How I learn good programming skills by learning Drupal, especially Drupal 7 and 8.</li>
                        <li>The single most important skill to have for becoming better programmer, and how to train that skill.</li>
                        <li>New concepts in Drupal 8 which may put off people coming from hobbyist background like me: OOP, services, containers, dependency injection.</li>
                        <li>If there is enough time, I will share configuration management, Twig template engine and how Drupal Console keeps us happy as Drupal developer.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h4>S J</h4>
                      <p>SJ eats, sleeps, and breathes Drupal. Since knowing Drupal in 2005, he has helped clients launch complex scalable platforms on Drupal. His knowledge and skills on system and large architecture design have made big complex sites like Singtel, I²R, XinMSN / Toggle manageable by a small team of people. He always strives for building platforms which help other people lead happier, more productive and more fulfilling lives. When he’s not busy with his family, he’s active in the Singapore Drupal community by organising meetups and workshops.</p>

                      <p>Beginning with PSR-0, the PHP Framework Interoperability Group (PHP FIG) has been producing standards for PHP for almost 7 years now and now can boast a complement over a dozen specifications in progress or complete. Its goal is to make your life, as a developer, easier, whether that be through providing a common coding style guide to reduce cognitive friction or interfaces for interoperability. This has not always been easy, but slowly and gradually the FIG is stamping down boundaries between projects and people in the name of interoperability, cohesion and collaboration. Join me for a tale of how the FIG has grown, and continues to grow, whilst trying to bring the PHP community together.</p>

                      <h4>Teaching PHP new tricks with machine learning</h4>
                      <p>Machine learning is teaching the computer how to learn by itself. It is far easier to be done, especially when you have small data set and a good level of expertise in your field. Classifying objects, predicting who will buy, spotting comments in code is achieved with grassy algorithms like neural networks, genetic algorithms or ant herding. PHP is in good position to make use of such teachings, and take advantages of related technologies like fann. By the end of the session, you'll know where you want to try it.</p>

While in high school, I have worked for my first customers and created initial bits of code, which ultimately became an Open Source project. Few years into the future, Sylius is one of the most promising eCommerce platforms in the world of PHP, with over 320 code contributors. Our packages have been downloaded over 2,000,000 times.
              These days I am busy leading the project towards stable release and managing a commercial, company Lakion that emerged from Sylius’ popularity in 2014. We support the community and provide training, consultation and development for brands & start-ups who want to power their business with Sylius technology.
              I am also involved in my local PHP community, as co-organizer of PHPers, which is all about free and open meetups for developers in most of big cities in Poland. We are aiming to change the perception of PHP as a language and bring more people to the community by sharing knowledge and socializing.

          <h3>About Singapore</h3>
          <blockquote>
            Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is a modern city-state and island country in Southeast Asia. It lies off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and is 137 kilometres (85 mi) north of the equator. The country's territory consists of the diamond-shaped main island, commonly referred to as Singapore Island in English and Pulau Ujong in Malay, and more than 60 significantly smaller islets. Singapore is separated from Peninsular Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the north, and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to the south. Singapore is highly urbanised. Land reclamation has been used to expand the country's land area.
