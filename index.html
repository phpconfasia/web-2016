                      <h4>Understanding and Implementing PSR</h4>
                      <p>PHP developers today are spoilt for choice when choosing a framework to use for their applications. Frameworks have come a long way from isolated libraries of code to embodiments of design patterns and best practices. This is in no small way due to PSR (PHP Standard Recommendation). Thanks to it, one can even mix and match components from different frameworks! This tutorial seeks to bring more awareness, appreciation and encourage adoption of PSRs as we sit down together to understand the fundamentals and try our hands at implementing some of them.</p>

              <p>Most recently, I worked for six years at Facebook using PHP and Hack (Facebook's PHP version). I worked on a variety of high-level projects such as: huge data migrations, pages timeline, photos, the ORM system used internally, code generation and the external Ads API. Prior to Facebook, I worked for TopCoder for four years, doing web development in Java.
              I started programming games in Basic when I was nine years old in a CZ Spectrum computer, and later switched to a PC where I learned Turbo Pascal and C++. Since then, programming has been my passion, my work and something I am excited to share with the community at large.
              I have recently presented at the New Zealand PHP Conference 2015 and the PHP Conference Argentina, and I'm going to present in the Dutch PHP Conference. I genuinely enjoy speaking at conferences and contributing my knowledge and expertise in PHP and other technologies.</p>

              <p>Born in November 1992, I have built my first website at the age of 12. While in high school, I have worked for my first customers and created initial bits of code, which ultimately became an Open Source project. Few years into the future, Sylius is one of the most promising eCommerce platforms in the world of PHP, with over 320 code contributors. Our packages have been downloaded over 2,000,000 times.
              These days I am busy leading the project towards stable release and managing a commercial, company Lakion that emerged from Sylius’ popularity in 2014. We support the community and provide training, consultation and development for brands & start-ups who want to power their business with Sylius technology.
              I am also involved in my local PHP community, as co-organizer of PHPers, which is all about free and open meetups for developers in most of big cities in Poland. We are aiming to change the perception of PHP as a language and bring more people to the community by sharing knowledge and socializing. I am responsible for organizing PHPers events in my hometown - Łódź.</p>

          <h3>About Singapore</h3>
          <blockquote>
            Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is a modern city-state and island country in Southeast Asia. It lies off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and is 137 kilometres (85 mi) north of the equator. The country's territory consists of the diamond-shaped main island, commonly referred to as Singapore Island in English and Pulau Ujong in Malay, and more than 60 significantly smaller islets. Singapore is separated from Peninsular Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the north, and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to the south. Singapore is highly urbanised. Land reclamation has been used to expand the country's land area.
